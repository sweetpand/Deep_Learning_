        "Language model prompting is one of the 🔥 hottest topics in NLP lately. Language model prompting allows one to reformulate a variety of tasks as a simple auto-regressive generation problem (see Joe Davidson's [tweet](https://twitter.com/joeddav/status/1390731854907641863) for more information). \n",

        "In this short colab, we will demonstrate how 🤗 Transformers' new `generate` function in Flax can be up to **8x faster** on TPU than its PyTorch implementation in 🤗 Transformers' on GPU. Flax's `generate` function can also easily be spread over multiple TPUs for parallel generation.\n",
